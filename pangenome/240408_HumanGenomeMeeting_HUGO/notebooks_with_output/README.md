You can see how the notebooks look like after being run, i.e. with all the log and graphic outputs.

- [hprc_hugo24_pggb.ipynb](hprc_hugo24_pggb.ipynb) on the construction and analysis of pangenomes with PGGB.
- [RHD-RHCE - Small variant calling with Giraffe-DeepVariant.ipynb](<RHD-RHCE - Small variant calling with Giraffe-DeepVariant.ipynb>) about mapping reads with Giraffe and calling small variants with DeepVariant in the RHD-RHCE region.
- [pangenome-sv-genotyping.ipynb](pangenome-sv-genotyping.ipynb) with a simple example of mapping reads with giraffe and genotyping variants.

You can also find the HTML reports and other outputs of the nf-core/pangenome Nextflow run in `chrY.hprc.pan4_out`, and other PDF files from the PGGB notebook.
