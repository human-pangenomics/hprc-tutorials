### HPRC Pangenome Workshop at the Human Genome Meeting (Rome 2024)

This workshop took place in Rome on April, 8 2024 for [Human Genome Meeting (HUGO)](https://www.hugo-hgm2024.org/).
After some introductions around the project and pangenomes, the participants first built and analyzed pangenomes with [PGGB](https://github.com/pangenome/pggb). 
In the second part, [Giraffe](https://github.com/vgteam/vg) was used to map short sequencing reads to a slice of the HPRC pangenome and small variants were called using [DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant).

The materials for the workshop are available under [`hprc-tutorials/pangenome/240408_HumanGenomeMeeting_HUGO`](hprc-tutorials/pangenome/240408_HumanGenomeMeeting_HUGO).

### Short Read Variant Calling With Giraffe & DeepVariant
This tutorial demonstrates variant calling using the Human Pangenome Reference Consortium's (HPRC) year 1 Minigraph/CACTUS pangenome with the Giraffe/DeepVariant pipeline for calling germline small variants. This workspace is intended to be a demonstration of utilizing a pangenome from the HPRC in AnVIL and Terra.

Instructions and a brief overview of the process can be found under `pangenome/giraffe-deepvariant`.
