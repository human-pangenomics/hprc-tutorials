# Day: Section Title
Motivation for section. What is the background? Why are we doing what we are about to do. What should you take home from this?

## Perform a task
*Each section should take around 15 minutes. Longer is fine. Participants will try it themselves then we will go over it together.*
*Sections in bold should be given unique names -- the current names are what the subsection is doing*

**Create directory for section** (not a rule, but nice for organization)
```
mkdir section_name
```
**Run command**
```
Command \
	wrapped \
	>output.txt
```

Now view the runtime parameters
```
Command
```

**Question what we did** (optional)<br>
(Example questions)
* Why did we run with X parameter?
* What does the Y parameter do?

**Notes** (optional)<br>
(Example notes)
* Did we take any shortcuts?
* Are there other tools that could be used?
* How long is a typical runtime?

**Understanding**<br>
(Examples)
* Rerun with other parameters (cool, but hard)
* Look at output with bash/python commands (recommended)
* Look at log file

**Take Home**<br>
What did we just do and how does it apply to our overall goal of making nice assemblies (and using them)?
