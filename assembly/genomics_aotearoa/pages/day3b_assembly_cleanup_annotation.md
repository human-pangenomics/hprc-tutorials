# Day 3b: Assembly Cleanup & Genome Annotation


## Assembly Cleanup
Once you have a genome, and you think you want to hold onto it for a while and start doing actual analysis it is time to check it for contamination. In particular, before using and sharing your assembly it is best to make sure that you don't have:
* contamination from other species
* lot's of contigs for Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) or mitochondrial sequence
* adapters embedded in your contigs

When you upload your assembly to Genbank, the sequence is automatically screen for contaminants and if anything is found you have to fix it and upload the fixed assembly. It's much better to take a look on your end. Luckily NCBI has released a version of their screening tool that can be run locally, so we will do that now.

**Make a directory**
```
cd ~
mkdir -p day3_qc/fcs/
cd day3_qc/fcs/
```

**Download the Foreign Contamination Screen (FCS) tool from NCBI**

```
curl -LO https://github.com/ncbi/fcs/raw/main/dist/fcs.py
curl -LO https://github.com/ncbi/fcs/raw/main/examples/fcsgx_test.fa.gz
```

This tool is a python script that calls a Docker/Singularity container. This was done because contamination screens notoriously require a ton of dependencies. So having a Docker container makes things easier on the user. The docker container requires that a database of contaminants are downloaded. We have already downloaded the test database here: `/nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/fcs/test-only`. The container has already been downloaded as well, we just need to load the singularity module and let FCS know where the container is:
```
module load Singularity
export FCS_DEFAULT_IMAGE=/opt/nesi/containers/fcs/fcs-gx-0.4.0.sif
```

**Now we can run the test data**
```
python3 ./fcs.py \
    screen genome \
    --fasta ./fcsgx_test.fa.gz \
    --out-dir ./gx_out \
    --gx-db /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/fcs/test-only  \
    --tax-id 6973 
```
Now perform a full run
```
cp /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/assemblies/verkko/full/trio/assembly/assembly.haplotype1.fasta .
```

```
nano fcs_full.sl
```
And paste in the following
```
#!/bin/bash -e

#SBATCH --account       nesi02659
#SBATCH --job-name      test_fcs
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 24
#SBATCH --time          03:00:00
#SBATCH --mem           460G
#SBATCH --output        slurmlogs/test.slurmoutput.%x.%j.log
#SBATCH --error         slurmlogs/test.slurmoutput.%x.%j.err

## load modules
module purge
module load Python/3.7.3-gimkl-2018b
module load Singularity/3.11.3
export FCS_DEFAULT_IMAGE=/opt/nesi/containers/fcs/fcs-gx-0.4.0.sif

python3 /home/juklucas/day3_qc/fcs/fcs.py \
    screen genome \
    --fasta ./assembly.haplotype1.fasta \
    --out-dir ./asm_fcs_output \
    --gx-db /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/fcs/gxdb \
    --tax-id 9606 
```
Now execute the job
```
sbatch fcs_full.sl
```

## Genome Annotation

A genome assembly &ndash; even a very good one &ndash; is of limited utility
without annotation to provide context about the raw bases. Broadly speaking, an
annotation is any information about some region of the genome, e.g., the GC% in
a given window or whether and in which way a particular region is repetitive.
Accordingly, annotation techniques, computational resources, input requirements,
and output formats can vary widely.  However, the term "annotation" typically
refers to the more specific case of locating the protein-coding genes, ideally
specifying features such as exon-intron boundaries, untranslated regions (UTRs),
splice variants, etc. Accordingly, we will focus on this type of annotation
here.

When annotating genes, many methods and tools are available, depending on your
objective. When planning a project, you might ask yourself: Do I want
<abbr title="Structural annotation describes the structure of the gene or
transcript, e.g., exon-intron boundaries, UTRs, etc.">structural
annotation</abbr>, <abbr title="Functional annotation describes the known or
anticipated function, e.g., protein-coding, gene <X> or part of <X> gene family,
similar to <Y> organism's <Z> gene, etc.">functional annotation</abbr>, or both?
Do I want to locate genes using _de novo_ prediction models, transcript- or
RNA-seq-based evidence, or both? Do I have a reliable source of annotations from
the assembly of a related genome? Do I have a collaborator willing and able to
perform the annotation for me?

A full discussion or tutorial covering the various scenarios is beyond the scope
of this workshop, but pipelines like
[MAKER](https://yandell-lab.org/software/maker.html) (Holt and Yandell, 2011;
doi: [10.1186/1471-2105-12-491](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-12-491)) can
be configured to do many of these things, though installing all necessary
dependencies can be challenging in some circumstances. Many tools also assume
short reads (e.g., when using RNA-seq evidence), and incorporating information
from long-read sources may require adjustments.

Here we will get a taste for annotation with one popular tool: Liftoff, which
makes use of another genome assembly with annotations you wish to "copy" onto
your assembly.

<details>
    <summary>
        <strong>What is the easiest way to annotate my genome of interest?</strong>
    </summary>
    The easiest way to get a genome annotated is to have someone else do it. If
    sharing data with NCBI is possible and your assembly is the best option to
    represent your species of interest, they may be willing to annotate your
    genome for you using
    <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/">their pipeline</a>.
    Otherwise, finding a collaborator with expertise is a good option.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>
        <strong>What are the most common formats for sharing annotation data?</strong>
    </summary>
    The most common formats are
    <a href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1">BED (Browser Extensible Data)</a>,
    <a href="https://gmod.org/wiki/GFF3">GFF (Generic Feature Format; v3)</a>,
    <a href="https://gmod.org/wiki/GFF2">GTF (General Transfer Format; a.k.a., deprecated GFF v2)</a>,
    and custom TSV (tab-separated value).
    <a href="http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/wiggle.html">Wiggle</a>
    format and its variants are also common for displaying information in a genome
    browser.

<details>
    <summary>
        <strong>Which tool(s) should I use for my project?</strong>
    </summary>
    Annotation is a complex problem, and no single tool exists that can be
    universally recommended. A high-quality annotation plan often requires the
    use of may tools and/or complex pipelines, and the installation of many of
    these tools can be complicated, even for expert command-line users.
    Generally speaking, following the best-practice of those in your field or
    who work on the same taxa is a reasonable option. In some cases, tools
    specific to some set of organisms have been developed (e.g., <a
    href="https://funannotate.readthedocs.io/">Funannotate</a> for fungi).
    Recently, the <a href="https://github.com/Gaius-Augustus/BRAKER">BRAKER</a>
    team released version 3 of their pipeline for gene structure prediction
    (wrapping GeneMark-ES/ET & AUGUSTUS). If you have a trustworthy source of
    annotations from another assembly, you can consider <a
    href="https://github.com/agshumate/Liftoff">Liftoff</a> and <a
    href="https://github.com/ComparativeGenomicsToolkit/Comparative-Annotation-Toolkit">CAT</a>.
    <a
    href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/about/interproscan/">InterProScan</a>
    can give you functional annotations relatively quickly. If you are able to
    share your data with NCBI and your assembly is the best assembly (or if the
    community agrees it is otherwise preferred), they NCBI annotation team will
    annotate it for you using their automated pipeline. <a
    href="https://gff3toolkit.readthedocs.io/">GFF3 Toolkit</a> can be useful
    when working with GFF3 files, and <a
    href="https://gfacs.readthedocs.io">gFACs</a> can help with filtering,
    analysis, and conversion tasks.

### Annotation with Liftoff

According to the
[Liftoff GitHub Repository](https://github.com/agshumate/Liftoff):
> Liftoff is a tool that accurately maps annotations in GFF or GTF between
> assemblies of the same, or closely-related species. Unlike current coordinate
> lift-over tools which require a pre-generated "chain" file as input, Liftoff
> is a standalone tool that takes two genome assemblies and a reference
> annotation as input and outputs an annotation of the target genome. Liftoff
> uses Minimap2 (Li, 2018; doi:
> [10.1093/bioinformatics/bty191](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty191))
> to align the gene sequences from a reference genome to the target genome.
> Rather than aligning whole genomes, aligning only the gene sequences allows
> genes to be lifted over even if there are many structural differences between
> the two genomes. For each gene, Liftoff finds the alignments of the exons
> that maximize sequence identity while preserving the transcript and gene
> structure. If two genes incorrectly map to overlapping loci, Liftoff
> determines which gene is most-likely mis-mapped, and attempts to re-map it.
> Liftoff can also find additional gene copies present in the target assembly
> that are not annotated in the reference.

We will use Liftoff (doi:
[10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1016](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1016))
lift over the annotations from the T2T-CHM13 reference assembly to our assembly
of HG002.

**Create directory**

```shell
mkdir liftoff-annotation
cd liftoff-annotation
```

**Gather the necessary files**

```shell
ln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/chm13/CHM13-T2T.renamed.gff.gz chm13-annotations.gff.gz
ln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/chm13/CHM13-T2T.renamed.gff.liftoff.sqlite3 chm13-annotations.gff.liftoff.sqlite3
ln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/chm13/chm13v2.0.fa chm13.fa
ln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/chm13/chm13v2.0.fa.fai chm13.fa.fai
ln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/verkko_trio_prebaked/asm_hifiont/assembly.fasta asm.fa
ln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/verkko_trio_prebaked/asm_hifiont/assembly.fasta asm.fa.fai
```

<details>
    <summary>
        <strong>What&rsquo;s with the <code>*.sqlite3</code> file?</strong>
    </summary>
    Liftoff stores features from the GFF file in a SQLite database. The first
    part of any liftoff run processes the GFF file and creates the database,
    which by default is written to the same file location and name with a
    <code>_gz</code> appended to the end. If you experience an error at any
    point (e.g., failing to allocate enough memory to your job), liftoff will
    automatically re-create the database, even if that part of the process
    completed successfully previously. This SQLite database is from a previous
    run we did, and we&rsquo;ll use it in place of the GFF file to shave some
    time (~10 mins for a full human genome) during our run. If you run
    <code>liftoff -h</code>, you&rsquo;ll see that <code>-g</code> (to provide
    the input GFF file) and <code>-db</code> (to provide the input SQLite
    database) are interchangeable. We&rsquo;ll be using the database to save
    time, but we could instead use the other option and supply the GFF file.
	If you haven&rsquo;t yet viewed a GFF file, now would be a good time to
	check one out: <pre><code>less -S chm13-annotations.gff.gz</code></pre>
</details>

**Run Liftoff**

First create a shell script `liftoff.sh` with the following content:
```shell
#! /usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

module load Liftoff/1.6.3.2-gimkl-2022a-Python-3.11.3

liftoff \
    -p 8 \
    -db chm13-annotations.gff.liftoff.sqlite3 \
    -o asm.annotations.gff \
    asm.fa \
    chm13.fa
```

<details>
    <summary>
        <strong>What do each of these options do?</strong>
    </summary>
    <code>-p</code> specifies the number of threads to use. <code>-db</code> specifies the location of
    the SQLite database of features extracted by Liftoff from the GFF file with
    the input annotations for the reference. <code>-o</code> specifies the
    location of the GFF file with the output annotations for the target. The two
    positional parameters at the end are respectively the target assembly (our
    HG002 assembly) and the reference assembly (T2T-CHM13). Run the following
    command to see all the options described in more detail:
    <pre><code>liftoff -h</code></pre>
</details>

<!-- OTHER POSSIBLE OPTIONS
    -g chm13-annotations.gff
    -u unmapped_features.txt
    -m /path/to/minimap2-installation/bin/minimap2
    -infer_genes -OR- -infer_transcripts # depending on what the chm13-annotations.gff looks like
    -chroms chromosomes.csv
    -unplaced unplaced_seq_names.txt
    -copies # possibly with -sc 2 # diploid vs haploid assembly liftover
-->

Then submit it as a job with `sbatch`:
```
sbatch -J liftoff -N1 -n1 -c8 --mem=20G -t 0-01:30 -A nesi02659 -o %x.%j.log liftoff.sh
```

**Look at the output GFF3 file**

```shell
less -S asm.annotations.gff
```

You can also explore the files in Liftoff's intermediate directory:
`intermediate_files`.

**Visualize the annotations in a genome browser**

Before we visualize the annotations in IGV, it is best if we sort and index the
output GFF file:
```
module load IGV/2.9.4
igvtools sort asm.annotations.gff asm.annotations.sorted.gff
igvtools index asm.annotations.sorted.gff
```
These operations are small enough that you should not need to submit a job for
them.

To open IGV and view the annotations, do the following:
1. Open IGV
    1. Open a Virtual Desktop session from your Jupyter Lab Launcher
    2. Open the Terminal Emulator application
    3. Load the IGV module and launch IGV
       ```shell
       module load IGV/2.9.4
       igv.sh
       ```
2. Load the CHM13-T2T genome (instead of the default hg19): Genome > Load Genome from File... > `chm13.fa`
3. Load the GFF file: File > Load from File... > `asm.annotations.sorted.gff`
4. Explore

**What do you observe? Do you have any questions?**

# Long Read/Contig Mapping
We are ready to map long reads and assembly contigs to genomes. For this we need a set of tools that are differenct from what you might be used to using for Illumina data. You might be asking "what's the matter with bwa-mem for long reads?" It is [slow](https://lh3.github.io/2018/04/02/minimap2-and-the-future-of-bwa#:~:text=For%20long%20reads%2C%20minimap2%20is,a%20typical%20long%2Dread%20mapper.) and probably inaccurate for this application. So let's jump in to long read mappers and see what we can do with them.

## Mashmap: Super Fast (Approximate) Mapping
The first thing we would like to do is to find out how our assembled genome compares to the T2T genome CHM13. If we can map our assembly quickly onto CHM13, we can answer questions like:
* Which contigs correspond to chr1?
* How many of my contigs are T2T assembled?
* Are we seeing any large duplications or missing regions?

[MashMap](https://genomeinformatics.github.io/mashmap/) is a super fast mapper that is commonly used for these kinds of questions. MashMap doesn't seed and extend, it takes sequences and plays tricks with kmers. Loosely speaking if you take a sequence and get all of its kmers of a certain size and then sort those kmers, you can do a lot with just the "smallest" kmer (this is called a minimizer). MashMap uses a set of those smallest kmers to say: this sequence here and my query sequence share a lot of smallest kmers. The output of MashMap is an approximation of read position and identity. Let's actually use it now to align our asembly to CHM13 and we will use the results to map our contigs onto chromosomes and to try and find some T2T chromosomes in our assemblies.

**Create A Directory**
```
cd ~
mkdir -p day3b_annotation/mashmap
cd day3b_annotation/mashmap
```

**Link the files we need**

We are going to use CHM13 v2.0 (which includes a Y chromosome)
```
ln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/chm13/chm13v2.0.fa
```
as well as haplotype 1 from our Verkko trio assembly
```
ln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/assemblies/verkko/full/trio/assembly/assembly.haplotype1.fasta
```

**Run MashMap**
```
mashmap \
  -r chm13v2.0.fa \
  -q assembly.haplotype1.fasta \
  -f one-to-one \
  --pi 95 \
  -s 100000 \
  -t 4 \
  -o asm-to-chm13.mashmap.out
```

<details>
    <summary>
        <strong>Take a look at the parameters for MashMap. What are -f, --pi, and -s?</strong>
    </summary>    
    --pi is the percent identity. The default value is 85 which means that mappings with 85% or more identity should be reported. -s is the segment length. MasMap will not report segments under this value. -f is the filter mode. After MashMap identifies mappings, it can go through and filter to ensure only the best mapping is reported (if we pass "map") or in our case that all good mappings are reported (if we pass "one-to-one").
</details>


<details>
    <summary>
        <strong>Why did we use the values that we used for --pi and -s?</strong>
    </summary>    
    Since we are mapping a human assembly against another human assembly we expect the sequences to be very similar. This is why we overwrote the default value of 85 for --pi. If we were to use the default value for -s (5000) then we would likely see a lot of hits from homologous regions. This may be interesting, but if we want to know how good our assembly is extra hits will just confuse things.
</details>

**Once the mapping is done, let's take a look at the output.**
```
head asm-to-chm13.mashmap.out
```
Note that the output is similar to the Paired Alignment Format, or [PAF](https://github.com/lh3/miniasm/blob/master/PAF.md), and has the following columns:
* query name
* length
* 0-based start
* end
* strand
* target name
* length
* start
* end 
* mapping nucleotide identity (estimate)


The most recent versions of MashMap actually output PAF by defalt. But not the version we are using here. 

**Now generate a dot plot of the alignment**
```
generateDotPlot png medium asm-to-chm13.mashmap.out
```
And take a look at it (you can click on it in your file explorer).

<details>
    <summary>
        <strong>Does anything stick out to you?</strong>
    </summary>    
    There is no sequence in the assembly mapping to chrY. This makes sense as this is the maternal haplotype's assembly. 
</details>


### Exercise: Can We Find Any Contigs/Scaffolds That Are T2T?

Look through the dotplot to try and identify a contig or two that are assembled T2T. Once you've done that we will have to bring in another tool to make sure that there are actually telomeric repeats on the 5' and 3' ends. (Some people care about the presence of telomeric repeats when defining what T2T means.)

Run the `telo` tool from seqtk to identify (human) telomeric ends:
```
seqtk telo assembly.haplotype1.fasta > telos.bed
```

Now look through the bed file and find the contig you are interested in to see if there are telomeres on both ends. 

<details>
    <summary>
        <strong>Did you find any T2T contigs or Scaffolds?</strong>
    </summary>    
    In this assembly chromosomes 3, 10, 11, and 16 are assembled T2T with contigs (no gaps) and chr5 is assembled T2T in a scaffold. As of the writing of this document (June 2023) for a diploid human assembly you can expect to get around 12 chromosomes assembled T2T in contigs and an additional 12 or so assembled T2T in scaffolds with Verkko. Hifiasm is very similar but without scaffolds. This means that for a diploid verkko assembly about half of the chromosomes are T2T out of the box for ~40X HiFi and >15X (or so) UL ONT with either HiC or trio phasing. Pretty amazing. This sample (HG002) is not very heterozygous so it's actually a tough sample to assemble. That is why we aren't seeing very many T2T contigs/scaffolds. Sometimes you have to judge how good an assembly is on a per-sample basis.
</details>

**Closing notes**
1. This could all be automated, of course. The T2T and HPRC consortiums have workflows that go through assemblies to determine T2T status at the chromosomal level, but those workflows are pretty similar to what we did above, actually. 

2. Not having base-level information is actually ok for what we just did. If you would like base level information at only a few fold the run cost of mashmap (so still very fast), then you probably want to check out [wfmash](https://github.com/waveygang/wfmash/blob/master/README.md). It can be used for alignments of long reads (100kb+) or assemblies at very large scales.

## Minimap2: 
If you are mapping long read data and you'd like to have base-level alignment, minimap2 is probably your first stop. 

Today we are going to use minimap2 to align ONT reads that have 5mC information stored in Mm/Ml tags to our diploid assembly.

**Create A Directory**
```
cd ~
mkdir -p lra/day3b_annotation/minimap2
cd lra/day3b_annotation/minimap2
```

**Copy over our Verkko trio assembly**

We are going to use the diploid version of our Verkko trio assembly. (This just means that the maternal and paternal haplotypes are both included in the fasta.)
```
cp \
    /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/assemblies/verkko/full/trio/assembly/assembly.fasta \

**Create a minimap2 slurm script**

This should only take 3 hours or so, but we have some pre-baked results for you already. We will use these results in the next section.

        <strong>Why did we align to the diploid version of our assembly?</strong>
    </summary>    
    The traditional thing to do is to align your data to a haploid or pseudo-haploid assembly like CHM13 or GRCh38. We are diploid individuals, though. And for some use cases we want to align long reads to a diploid assembly in order to have the reads segregate by haplotype. When we are aligning a samples reads to its own assembly this is especially important.

### Visualize The Alignments In IGV

**Before switching over to your virtual desktop link the prerun alignments to your working directory**
```
ln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/ont_ul/aligned/verkko_trio_diploid.mm2.5mC.bam
ln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/ont_ul/aligned/verkko_trio_diploid.mm2.5mC.bam.bai
```

**Now view the alignments in IGV**
1. Open an IGV window as you did above. Don't forget to `module load IGV/2.16.1` (we need v 2.14 or greater)
2. We need to use our assembly as the genome file. Do that by clicking the **Genomes** dropdown at the top and then select **Load Genome From File**. Navigate to your folder and select the Verkko trio genome that we copied in.
3. Load the 5mC bam by clicking on the **File** dropdown then selecting **Load From File**
4. Show the methylation predictions by right clicking on the alignment track and selecting **Color alignments by**, then click **base modifications (5mc)**

**Explore the data a bit**

Zoom in on a random region that is a few hundred basepairs in size. You can see the methylation levels in the track histogram and in the reads themselves. Red is methylated and blue is unmethylated.

If you are familiar with ONT data already you know that ONT and PacBio have the ability to detect base modifications without any additional steps like bisulfite conversion. What we are adding here is the ability to look at methylation in the context of a sample's own assembly. Maybe that wouldn't matter if you are looking at regions of the genome which are structurally consistent across samples -- like promoters for well known genes. 

Now let's take a look at a region where it matters that we are using a matched data and sample:
Navigate to  `mat-0000038:51,448,000 - 51,510,000`. This is the biggest contig that maps to chrX and we chose a region that is usually where the centromere is on chrX. 

You will notice that most of the view has very high levels of methylation, but there are some regions where the methylation drops to near zero. These are called the centromere dip regions.

    <summary>
        <strong>Why did we choose to show you an example in chrX?</strong>
    </summary>    
    In male samples chrX is haploid, so outside of the psuedoautosomal, or PAR, regions we don't have to worry about whether or not our reads map to the correct haplotype.

    <summary>
        <strong>What would have happened if we had just aligned this data to CHM13?</strong>
    </summary>    
    Centromeres are highly repetitive and alpha satellite arrays can vary from individual to individual in size by more than a factor of two. So aligning centromeric reads from one individual to another individual's assembly is an inherently dodgy proposition.
